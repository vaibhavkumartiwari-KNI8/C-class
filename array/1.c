//1d array single dimensional 
// a linear list of elements (datatype name_array [size])
/* mullti dimensional array
represents as a matrix  of rows and coloumns 
syntax 
(datatype namearr [r][c])
acess it on the basis of rows and coloumns 
*/
/*
it is used to represent data in like a que in length breath and height 
applications of array 
aaray are used to omplement data structure like stack used etc 
arrays can be used for cpu scheduling 
advantags of array 
1.
multiple data item sof same type can be declared using same name but different indexes 
2.
accessing an element becomes easy just by using index number
3.
arrays allocate memory in continous memory locatins hence no extra menmory is allocated
 
*/

/*
row major order
row major ordring assigns successive elements moving accross the rows and then down the next row to successive memory location 
the elements of an array are stored in a row wise fashion 

coloumn major order 
if elements of an array are stored in a coloumn wise fashion 
moving accros the coloumn and then to the next coloumn then its in coloumn major order 
*/

/*
sparse matrix 
the matrix which have more 0s as elements
